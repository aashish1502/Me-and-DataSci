<h1>This Github repo is all about machine learning and the basic tools used by me to learn it.</h1>
<h4>I am using python.</h4>
The topics I have covered are :
  <ol>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Matplotlib </li>
  <li>Seaborn</li>
  <li>Pandas for data viz</li>
  </ol>

<p>I will suggest using the website colab.google.research to view the ipnyb files as it is user friendly and has <strong> Dark MODE</strong></p>
